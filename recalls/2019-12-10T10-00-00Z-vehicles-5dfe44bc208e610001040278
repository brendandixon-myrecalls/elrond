(Marion Body Works) is recalling certain 2018-2019 Spartan Gladiator \u0026amp; Metro Star emergency response chassis. The brake relay valve may have an air flow restriction, which may result in an extended stopping distance. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 121, \"Air Brake Systems.\"","consequence":"If additional distance is needed to stop the vehicle, there would be an increased risk of crash.","remedy":"Marion Body Works will notify owners, and Spartan dealers will inspect and replace the valve, as necessary, free of charge.
