The brake relay valve may have an air flow restriction due to a partially blocked orifice, which may lead to extended stopping distance. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 121, \"Air Brake Systems.\"","consequence":"An increase in stopping distance without warning increases the risk of crash.","remedy":"Newmar will notify owners, and Spartan dealers will inspect and replace the brake relay valve, if necessary, free of charge.
