The CNG tanks are equipped with Luxfer valves recalled under 18E-111. If the valve knob is turned more than one turn, the valve's snap ring may fail and the valve stem may forcibly eject from the valve body.","consequence":"The forcible ejection of the stem may increase the risk of injury to those nearby. Additionally, the unintended release of CNG can increase the risk of a fire.","remedy":"Labrie Enviroquip will notify owners, and Luxfer will provide an upgrade kit for the valves which doubles the snap ring strength, free of charge. The manufacturer has not yet provided a notification schedule. Owners may contact Labrie Enviroquip customer service at 1-418-813-8250 or Luxfer at 1-403-720-0262.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68c08b079e002a2518b1","make":"LABRIE","model":"AUTOMIZER","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e68c08b079e002a2518b2","make":"LABRIE","model":"EXPERT","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e68c08b079e002a2518b3","make":"LABRIE","model":"AUTOMIZER","year":2017},{"id":"5d9e68c08b079e002a2518b4","make":"LABRIE","model":"EXPERT","year":2017}]}}}
