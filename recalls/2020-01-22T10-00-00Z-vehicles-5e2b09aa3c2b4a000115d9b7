These vehicles were equipped with Non-Azide Driver air bag Inflators (NADI) and do not contain phase stabilized ammonium nitrate (PSAN) propellant. Due to a manufacturing issue, the NADI inflators may absorb moisture, causing the inflators to rupture or the air bag cushion to underinflate.","consequence":"In the event of a crash necessitating air bag deployment, an inflator rupture may result in metal fragments striking the driver or other occupants. An underinflated air bag may not properly protect the occupant, and increases the risk of serious injury or death.","remedy":"The remedy for this recall is still under development. The recall is expected to begin March 22, 2020. Owners may contact Toyota customer service at 1-888-270-9371. Toyota's numbers for this recall is 20TB01 and 20TA01.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5e2b09aa3c2b4a000115d9b8","make":"TOYOTA","model":"RAV4","year":2000},{"id":"5e2b09aa3c2b4a000115d9b9","make":"TOYOTA","model":"CELICA","year":1999},{"id":"5e2b09aa3c2b4a000115d9ba","make":"TOYOTA","model":"RAV4","year":1999},{"id":"5e2b09aa3c2b4a000115d9bb","make":"TOYOTA","model":"CELICA","year":1998},{"id":"5e2b09aa3c2b4a000115d9bc","make":"TOYOTA","model":"RAV4","year":1998},{"id":"5e2b09aa3c2b4a000115d9bd","make":"TOYOTA","model":"SUPRA","year":1998},{"id":"5e2b09aa3c2b4a000115d9be","make":"TOYOTA","model":"SUPRA","year":1997}]}}}
