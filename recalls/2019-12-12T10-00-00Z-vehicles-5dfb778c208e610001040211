Due to an Electronic Brake Control Module (EBCM) software error, the vehicle's Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Antilock Brake System (ABS) may become disabled. Furthermore, if this specific error occurs, the vehicle's diagnostics will not illuminate the instrument cluster ESC and ABS malfunction warning lights. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 126, \"Electronic Stability Control\" and 135, \"Light Vehicle Brake Systems.\"","consequence":"If the driver operates the vehicle unaware that ESC and ABS are not functioning, there is an increased risk of a crash.","remedy":"GM will notify owners, and dealers will reprogram the EBCM, free of charge. The recall is expected to begin January 27, 2020.
