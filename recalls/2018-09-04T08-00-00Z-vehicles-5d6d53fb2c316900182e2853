The wheelchair lift positioning input cam may fail while the lift is in use, allowing the platform to travel higher than the vehicle floor height.","consequence":"If the wheelchair lift platform stops above the vehicle floor, the wheelchair user can tip inwards toward the vehicle when exiting the lift, increasing their risk of injury.","remedy":"Collins Bus will notify owners and Ricon dealers will replace the injection molded cam with an aluminum machined cam, free of charge. The recall is expected to begin October 2018. Owners may contact Collins Bus customer service at 1-800-533-1850 extension 424 or Ricon Customer Service at 1-800-322-2884.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68858b079e002a250a25","make":"COLLINS","model":"SCHOOL BUS","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e68858b079e002a250a26","make":"COLLINS","model":"SCHOOL BUS","year":2017},{"id":"5d9e68858b079e002a250a27","make":"COLLINS","model":"SCHOOL BUS","year":2016},{"id":"5d9e68858b079e002a250a28","make":"COLLINS","model":"SCHOOL BUS","year":2015},{"id":"5d9e68858b079e002a250a29","make":"COLLINS","model":"SCHOOL BUS","year":2014},{"id":"5d9e68858b079e002a250a2a","make":"COLLINS","model":"SCHOOL BUS","year":2013},{"id":"5d9e68858b079e002a250a2b","make":"COLLINS","model":"SCHOOL BUS","year":2012}]}}}
