The seats may have been manufactured with styrene blocks that may not provide sufficient impact absorption in certain specific areas around the steel seat frame of the back support. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 222, \"School Bus Passenger Seating and Crash Protection.\"","consequence":"The lack of impact absorption increases the risk of injury in the event of a crash.","remedy":"DTNA will notify owners, and dealers will install additional impact material between the re-bond back and the vinyl back cover to increase the amount of absorption, free of charge. The recall is expected to begin December 2, 2019. Owners may contact DTNA customer service at 1-800-547-0712. DTNA's number for this recall is FL-832.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54ca","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"MINOTOUR","year":2020},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54cb","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER C2","year":2020},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54cc","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER EFX","year":2020},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54cd","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER HDX","year":2020},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54ce","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"MINOTOUR","year":2019},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54cf","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER C2","year":2019},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54d0","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER EFX","year":2019},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54d1","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER HDX","year":2019},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54d2","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"MINOTOUR","year":2018},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54d3","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER C2","year":2018},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54d4","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER EFX","year":2018},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54d5","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER HDX","year":2018},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54d6","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"MINOTOUR","year":2017},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54d7","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER C2","year":2017},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54d8","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER EFX","year":2017},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54d9","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER HDX","year":2017},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54da","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"MINOTOUR","year":2016},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54db","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER C2","year":2016},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54dc","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER EFX","year":2016},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54dd","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER HDX","year":2016},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54de","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"MINOTOUR","year":2015},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54df","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER C2","year":2015},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54e0","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER EFX","year":2015},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54e1","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER HDX","year":2015},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54e2","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"MINOTOUR","year":2014},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54e3","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER C2","year":2014},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54e4","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER EFX","year":2014},{"id":"5db1a190d7897600012c54e5","make":"THOMAS BUILT BUSES","model":"SAF-T-LINER HDX","year":2014}]}}}
