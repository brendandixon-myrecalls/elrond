The affected vehicles are equipped with a dual-stage driver frontal air bag that may be susceptible to moisture intrusion and other factors, including manufacturing variability that, over time, could cause the inflator to rupture.","consequence":"In the event of a crash necessitating deployment of the driver's frontal air bag, the inflator could rupture with metal fragments striking the driver or other occupants resulting in serious injury or death.","remedy":"Honda will notify owners, and dealers will replace the driver frontal air bag inflator, free of charge. The recall began on July 1, 2015. Owners may contact Honda customer service at 1-888-234-2138. Owners may contact Acura customer service at 1-800-382-2238, select option 4. Note: Vehicles that have had their driver frontal air bag replaced previously as part of a recall remedy prior to September 12, 2014 need to have their air bag replaced under this recall as well. Vehicles that, on or after September 12, 2014, received a remedy for a prior driver frontal air bag inflator recall already received an inflator of a different design, and therefore are not included in this recall and do not require additional servicing. Note: This recall fully supersedes recalls 08V-593, 09V-259, 10V-041, 11V-260, 14V-351 and 15V-153.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da2c","make":"HONDA","model":"ELEMENT","year":2011},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da2d","make":"HONDA","model":"ELEMENT","year":2010},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da2e","make":"HONDA","model":"ELEMENT","year":2009},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da2f","make":"HONDA","model":"ELEMENT","year":2008},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da30","make":"HONDA","model":"PILOT","year":2008},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da31","make":"HONDA","model":"ACCORD","year":2007},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da32","make":"HONDA","model":"ELEMENT","year":2007},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da33","make":"HONDA","model":"PILOT","year":2007},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da34","make":"ACURA","model":"MDX","year":2006},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da35","make":"HONDA","model":"ACCORD","year":2006},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da36","make":"HONDA","model":"CR-V","year":2006},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da37","make":"HONDA","model":"ELEMENT","year":2006},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da38","make":"HONDA","model":"PILOT","year":2006},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da39","make":"HONDA","model":"RIDGELINE","year":2006},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da3a","make":"ACURA","model":"MDX","year":2005},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da3b","make":"HONDA","model":"ACCORD","year":2005},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da3c","make":"HONDA","model":"CIVIC","year":2005},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da3d","make":"HONDA","model":"CIVIC HYBRID","year":2005},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da3e","make":"HONDA","model":"CR-V","year":2005},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da3f","make":"HONDA","model":"ELEMENT","year":2005},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da40","make":"HONDA","model":"PILOT","year":2005},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da41","make":"ACURA","model":"MDX","year":2004},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da42","make":"HONDA","model":"ACCORD","year":2004},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da43","make":"HONDA","model":"CIVIC","year":2004},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da44","make":"HONDA","model":"CIVIC GX","year":2004},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da45","make":"HONDA","model":"CIVIC HYBRID","year":2004},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da46","make":"HONDA","model":"CR-V","year":2004},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da47","make":"HONDA","model":"ELEMENT","year":2004},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da48","make":"HONDA","model":"ODYSSEY","year":2004},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da49","make":"HONDA","model":"PILOT","year":2004},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da4a","make":"ACURA","model":"CL","year":2003},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da4b","make":"ACURA","model":"MDX","year":2003},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da4c","make":"ACURA","model":"TL","year":2003},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da4d","make":"HONDA","model":"ACCORD","year":2003},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da4e","make":"HONDA","model":"CIVIC","year":2003},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da4f","make":"HONDA","model":"CIVIC GX","year":2003},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da50","make":"HONDA","model":"CIVIC HYBRID","year":2003},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da51","make":"HONDA","model":"CR-V","year":2003},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da52","make":"HONDA","model":"ELEMENT","year":2003},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da53","make":"HONDA","model":"ODYSSEY","year":2003},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da54","make":"HONDA","model":"PILOT","year":2003},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da55","make":"ACURA","model":"TL","year":2002},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da56","make":"HONDA","model":"ACCORD","year":2002},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da57","make":"HONDA","model":"CIVIC","year":2002},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da58","make":"HONDA","model":"CIVIC GX","year":2002},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da59","make":"HONDA","model":"CR-V","year":2002},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da5a","make":"HONDA","model":"ODYSSEY","year":2002},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da5b","make":"HONDA","model":"ACCORD","year":2001},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da5c","make":"HONDA","model":"CIVIC","year":2001},{"id":"5e3579e93c2b4a000115da5d","make":"HONDA","model":"CIVIC GX","year":2001}]}}}
