(Winnebago) is recalling certain 2014 Metro Link vehicles equipped with Ricon S-Series and K-Series Titanium Wheelchair Lifts. The wheelchair lift positioning input cam may fail while the lift is in use, allowing the platform to travel higher than the vehicle's floor height. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 403, \"Platform Lift Systems.\"","consequence":"If the wheelchair lift platform stops above the vehicle floor, the wheelchair user can tip inwards toward the vehicle when exiting the lift, increasing their risk of injury.","remedy":"Winnebago will notify owners and Ricon dealers will replace the lift positioning input cam, free of charge. The recall began on February 26, 2019. Owners may contact Ricon customer service at 1-800-322-2884. Winnebago's number for this recall is 157.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68b28b079e002a251581","make":"WINNEBAGO","model":"METRO LINK","year":2014}]}}}
