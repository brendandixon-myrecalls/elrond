The integrated backup battery compartment located underneath the front passenger's seat may not have its own cover, potentially exposing the battery when the seat is moved forward.","consequence":"If conductive material, such as metal, unintentionally drops into the opening and contacts the terminals on the battery, an electrical short can occur, increasing the risk of a fire.","remedy":"DVUSA will notify owners, and Mercedes-Benz dealers will install covers over the battery compartment area, free of charge. The recall is expected to begin November 22, 2019. Owners may contact DVUSA customer service at 1-877-762-8267.
