The rear wheel speed sensor harnesses may have been routed to the incorrect rear wheels, resulting in the possibility that the anti-lock brake system will not recognize each rear wheel speed properly. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 135, \"Light Vehicle Brake System\" and 404, \"Electronic Stability Control Systems.\"","consequence":"If the rear wheel speeds cannot be correctly monitored, the anti-lock brake system may not engage properly to prevent the wheels from locking up, increasing the risk of crash.","remedy":"Braun has notified owners, and dealers will inspect and correct the rear wheel speed sensor harnesses, if necessary, free of charge. The recall began on April 4, 2019. Owners may contact Braun customer service at 1-800-488-0359.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68bc8b079e002a251803","make":"HONDA","model":"ODYSSEY","year":2019},{"id":"5d9e68bc8b079e002a251804","make":"HONDA","model":"ODYSSEY","year":2018}]}}}
