The spring cage bolts on the air brakes may not be sufficiently tightened, reducing the effectiveness of the parking brake.","consequence":"Loose cage bolts may result in the bus rolling away when in the park position or a loss of braking ability if the service brake air pressure is lost while moving. Either condition may increase the risk of a crash.","remedy":"Gillig will notify owners, and dealers will tighten the spring cage bolts, free of charge. The recall began December 10, 2018. Owners may contact Gillig customer service at 1-510-264-5073 or 1-800-735-1500.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e689a8b079e002a250f16","make":"GILLIG","model":"LOW FLOOR","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e689a8b079e002a250f17","make":"GILLIG","model":"LOW FLOOR","year":2017},{"id":"5d9e689a8b079e002a250f18","make":"GILLIG","model":"LOW FLOOR","year":2016},{"id":"5d9e689a8b079e002a250f19","make":"GILLIG","model":"LOW FLOOR","year":2015},{"id":"5d9e689a8b079e002a250f1a","make":"GILLIG","model":"LOW FLOOR","year":2014},{"id":"5d9e689a8b079e002a250f1b","make":"GILLIG","model":"LOW FLOOR","year":2013}]}}}
