(Fenton) is recalling certain 2015-2017 Ford Transit passenger vans modified to be equipped with Ricon S \u0026amp; K Titanium Wheelchair Lifts. The wheelchair lift positioning input cam may fail while the lift is in use, allowing the platform to travel higher than the vehicle's floor height. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 403, \"Platform Lift Systems.\"","consequence":"If the wheelchair lift platform stops above the vehicle floor, the wheelchair user can tip inwards toward the vehicle when exiting the lift, increasing their risk of injury.","remedy":"Fenton will notify owners, and a service technician will install Ricon Recall Parts Kit RI61396, free of charge. Owners may contact Fenton Mobility customer service at 1-716-484-7014. Fenton's number for this recall is RI61396.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68b88b079e002a251722","make":"FORD","model":"TRANSIT","year":2017},{"id":"5d9e68b88b079e002a251723","make":"FORD","model":"TRANSIT","year":2016},{"id":"5d9e68b88b079e002a251724","make":"FORD","model":"TRANSIT","year":2015}]}}}
