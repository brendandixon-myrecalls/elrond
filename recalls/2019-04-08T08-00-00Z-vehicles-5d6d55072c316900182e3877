Under heavy loads, the bolts that attach the hydraulic cylinder clevis to the scissor hoist can break.","consequence":"If the bolts break, the hydraulic cylinder may disengage from the scissor hoist, causing the dump box to lower back down onto the trailer frame at a rapid rate, increasing the risk of injury.","remedy":"Load Trail will notify owners, and dealers will add bracing and replace the clevis bolts with bolts that can support heavy loads, replacing any damaged parts as necessary, free of charge. The recall began June 6, 2019. Owners may contact Load Trail customer service at 1-903-783-3900.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68c28b079e002a25193e","make":"LOAD TRAIL","model":"TANDEM AXLE DUMP","year":2019},{"id":"5d9e68c28b079e002a25193f","make":"LOAD TRAIL","model":"TRIPLE AXLE DUMP","year":2019},{"id":"5d9e68c28b079e002a251940","make":"LOAD TRAIL","model":"TANDEM AXLE DUMP","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e68c28b079e002a251941","make":"LOAD TRAIL","model":"TRIPLE AXLE DUMP","year":2018}]}}}
