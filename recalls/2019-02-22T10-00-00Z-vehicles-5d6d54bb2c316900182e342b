High exhaust gas temperatures may damage the catalytic converter, possibly resulting in abnormal engine combustion and damage to one or more of the engine's pistons and possible piston connecting rod failure.","consequence":"Piston damage may result in an engine stall, increasing the risk of a crash. A broken connecting rod may puncture the engine block allowing engine oil to escape. The leaking oil may contact the exhaust, increasing the risk of a fire.","remedy":"Kia will notify owners, and dealers will upgrade the Catalytic Overheating Protection Engine Control Unit logic to prevent overheating of the catalytic converter. In addition, the catalytic converter will also be replaced if it has been damaged. Depending on the extent of any damage, the engine may also be replaced, free of charge. The recall began April 17, 2019. Owners may contact Kia customer service at 1-800-333-4542. Kia's number for this recall is SC176.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68b38b079e002a251591","make":"KIA","model":"SOUL","year":2016},{"id":"5d9e68b38b079e002a251592","make":"KIA","model":"SOUL","year":2015},{"id":"5d9e68b38b079e002a251593","make":"KIA","model":"SOUL","year":2014},{"id":"5d9e68b38b079e002a251594","make":"KIA","model":"SOUL","year":2013},{"id":"5d9e68b38b079e002a251595","make":"KIA","model":"SOUL","year":2012}]}}}
