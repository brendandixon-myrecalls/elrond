(Navistar) is recalling certain 2020 IC CE school buses equipped with PSI gasoline or propane engines and C7 Body Control Modules (BCM). An electrical overload condition in the BCM from the starter solenoid may occur and cause damage to the starter circuit of the BCM, possibly resulting in an unintended command to crank the engine when the ignition key is in the run position and the transmission is in the park or neutral position.","consequence":"If the ignition is in the run position and the engine starts unexpectedly while the vehicle is being serviced, there would be an increased risk of personal injury.","remedy":"Navistar will notify owners, and dealers will install an overlay harness and relay to provide electrical power to the starter circuit, instead of using the BCM to provide power. This repair will be performed free of charge. The recall is expected to begin September 13, 2019. Navistar's number for this recall is 19512.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68e78b079e002a2520e1","make":"IC BUS","model":"CE","year":2020}]}}}
