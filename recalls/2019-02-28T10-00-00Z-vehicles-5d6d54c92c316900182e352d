The CNG system has tanks with a one-turn for controlling CNG flow. If the valve knob is turned more than one turn, the valve's snap ring may fail and the valve stem may forcibly eject from the valve body. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 304, \"Compressed Natural gas Fuel Container Integrity.\"","consequence":"If the knob is overtightened, the valve retaining snap ring may fail and eject from the valve body, increasing the risk to injury to any person in it's path. Additionally, the unintended release of CNG can increase the risk of a fire.","remedy":"A-1 will notify owners, and dealers will double the snap ring strength, free of charge. The manufacturer has not yet provided a notification schedule. Owners may contact A-1 customer service at 1-559-485-4427.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68b58b079e002a25161d","make":"FREIGHTLINER","model":"1085D","year":2015},{"id":"5d9e68b58b079e002a25161e","make":"FREIGHTLINER","model":"M2","year":2015}]}}}
