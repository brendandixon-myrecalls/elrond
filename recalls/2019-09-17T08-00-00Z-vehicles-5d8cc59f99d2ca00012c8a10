(TransPower) is recalling certain 2017-2018 electric trucks built on Peterbilt 579 chassis. The vehicles do not have stabilization hardware and software that interacts with the braking system. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 136, \"Electronic Stability Control Systems on Heavy Vehicles.\"","consequence":"Without a Electronic Stability Control system, there is a greater chance of loss of stability control, which increases the risk of a crash.","remedy":"TransPower will notify owners, and dealers will install an Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system, free of charge. The recall is expected to begin in September 2019. Owners may contact TransPower customer service at 1-858-248-4255.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e69038b079e002a252443","make":"PETERBILT","model":"579","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e69038b079e002a252444","make":"PETERBILT","model":"579","year":2017}]}}}
