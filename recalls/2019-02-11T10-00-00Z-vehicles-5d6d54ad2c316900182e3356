The wheelchair lift positioning input cam may fail while the lift is in use, allowing the platform to travel higher than the vehicle's floor height. As such, this vehicle fails to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 403, \"Platform Lift Systems.\"","consequence":"If the wheelchair lift platform raises above the height of the vehicle floor, the wheelchair user could fall inwards toward the vehicle, increasing their risk of injury.","remedy":"Blue Bird will notify owners, and Ricon dealers will repair the input cam, free of charge. The recall began March 4, 2019. Owners may contact Ricon customer service at 1-800-322-2884.
