The bushing that attaches the transmission shifter cable to the transmission may degrade over time and cause the bushing to detach from the transmission. The condition could allow the driver to move the shift lever to Park and remove the ignition key, while the transmission may not be in Park, with no warning message or audible chime.","consequence":"If the vehicle is exited without the transmission being in Park and without the parking brake being applied, the vehicle may unexpectedly move, increasing the risk of a crash.","remedy":"Ford will notify owners, and dealers will replace the shifter cable bushing, free of charge. An interim owner notification letter was mailed May 30, 2019. A second letter will be sent once the remedy is available. Owners may contact Ford customer service at 1-866-436-7332. Ford's number for this recall is 19S16. Note: Owners are directed to use the parking brake until the recall remedy repairs can be made. This recall is an expansion of 18V471.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68cd8b079e002a251b26","make":"FORD","model":"FUSION","year":2016},{"id":"5d9e68cd8b079e002a251b27","make":"FORD","model":"FUSION","year":2015},{"id":"5d9e68cd8b079e002a251b28","make":"FORD","model":"FUSION","year":2014},{"id":"5d9e68cd8b079e002a251b29","make":"FORD","model":"FUSION","year":2013}]}}}
