The accessory all-weather floormats may have been counted twice when creating the load carrying capacity modification label, resulting in the capacity modification label incorrectly overstating the additional weight by 10 pounds. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 110, \"Tire Selection and Rims.\"","consequence":"Since the incorrect label is not within 1% of the additional weight, the vehicles are not compliant with the FMVSS.","remedy":"All vehicle owners will be sent a corrected label. Owners may contact Toyota customer service at 1-888-270-9371. Toyota's number for this recall is J0Z.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68918b079e002a250d53","make":"TOYOTA","model":"TUNDRA","year":2019},{"id":"5d9e68918b079e002a250d54","make":"TOYOTA","model":"TUNDRA","year":2018}]}}}
