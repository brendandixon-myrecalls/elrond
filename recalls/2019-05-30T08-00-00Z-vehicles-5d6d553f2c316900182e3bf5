(Proterra) is recalling certain 2017-2018 Catalyst buses. The vehicles are equipped with swivel valves that may insufficiently protect the air brake system from an air leak between the service reservoir and the source of air pressure. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 121, \"Air Brake Systems.\"","consequence":"If the swivel valves are unable to protect the air brake system against loss of air pressure, this may lead to service brake failure and the possibility for the uncontrolled application of the safety brake. Either condition increases the risk of crash.","remedy":"Proterra will notify owners, and will replace the swivel valve with a check valve that is sufficient to protect the air brake system, free of charge. The recall began July 26, 2019. Owners may contact Proterra customer service at 1-864-438-0000.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68d38b079e002a251cb2","make":"PROTERRA","model":"CATALYST","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e68d38b079e002a251cb3","make":"PROTERRA","model":"CATALYST","year":2017}]}}}
