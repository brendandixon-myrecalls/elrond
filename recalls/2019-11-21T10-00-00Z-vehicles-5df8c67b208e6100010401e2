(Navistar) is recalling certain 2020 International HV 6X4 vehicles. The vehicles were built with a non-Quick Release Modulator Valve (NQRMV) instead of a Quick Release Modulator Valve (QRMV), which may affect the brake release time. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 121, \"Air Brake Systems.\"","consequence":"A longer time required to exhaust the brake chambers could increase the risk of a brake or tire fire.","remedy":"Navistar will notify owners, and dealers will replace the NQRMV with a QRMV, free of charge. The recall is expected to begin January 20, 2020. Owners may contact Navistar customer service at 1-800-448-7825. Navistar's number for this recall is 19519.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5df8c67b208e6100010401e3","make":"INTERNATIONAL","model":"HV","year":2020}]}}}
