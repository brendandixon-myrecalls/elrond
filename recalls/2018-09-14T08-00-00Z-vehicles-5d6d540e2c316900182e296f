Due to incorrect software, the FCM-ECU (Electronic Control Unit) may apply braking for longer than needed, even after a pedestrian is no longer detected.","consequence":"If the FCM-ECU software activates the brake for longer than necessary, the driver may react by applying additional braking. The resulting rapid deceleration of the vehicle can increase the risk of a rear-end collision.","remedy":"MMNA will notify owners, and dealers will reprogram the FCM-ECU software with updated software, free of charge. The recall is began October 16, 2018. Owners may contact MMNA customer service at 1-888-648-7820. MMNA's number for this recall is SR-18-007.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e688a8b079e002a250b34","make":"MITSUBISHI","model":"ECLIPSE CROSS","year":2019},{"id":"5d9e688a8b079e002a250b35","make":"MITSUBISHI","model":"ECLIPSE CROSS","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e688a8b079e002a250b36","make":"MITSUBISHI","model":"OUTLANDER","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e688a8b079e002a250b37","make":"MITSUBISHI","model":"OUTLANDER PHEV","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e688a8b079e002a250b38","make":"MITSUBISHI","model":"OUTLANDER SPORT","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e688a8b079e002a250b39","make":"MITSUBISHI","model":"OUTLANDER","year":2017}]}}}
