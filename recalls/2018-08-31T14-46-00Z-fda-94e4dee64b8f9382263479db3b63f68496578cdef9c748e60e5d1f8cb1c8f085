In addition, Alcon advises surgeons to immediately cease further implantation with the CyPass Micro-Stent and to return any unused devices to Alcon. This decision and corresponding recommendation is based on an analysis of five-year post-surgery data from the COMPASS-XT long-term safety study. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the CyPass Micro-Stent in July 2016 for use in conjunction with cataract surgery in adult patients with mild-to-moderate primary open-angle glaucoma based on the results of the landmark two-year COMPASS study. The COMPASS study demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in intraocular pressure at two years post-surgery in subjects implanted with the CyPass Micro-Stent at the time of cataract surgery, as compared to subjects undergoing cataract surgery alone. At two years post-surgery, there was little difference in endothelial cell loss between the CyPass Micro-Stent and cataract surgery-only groups, and results were consistent with peer-review literature benchmarks of cataract-related endothelial cell loss.1, 2","link":"https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/alcon-announces-voluntary-global-market-withdrawal-cypass-micro-stent-surgical-glaucoma","publicationDate":"2018-08-31T14:46:00.000Z","state":"sent","affected":[],"allergens":[],"audience":["professionals"],"categories":["medical"],"contaminants":[],"distribution":["AL","AK","AZ","AR","CA","CO","CT","DE","DC","FL","GA","HI","ID","IL","IN","IA","KS","KY","LA","ME","MD","MA","MI","MN","MS","MO","MT","NE","NV","NH","NJ","NM","NY","NC","ND","OH","OK","OR","PA","RI","SC","SD","TN","TX","UT","VT","VA","WA","WV","WI","WY"],"risk":"possible","token":"5d9e68858b079e002a250a1a"}}}
