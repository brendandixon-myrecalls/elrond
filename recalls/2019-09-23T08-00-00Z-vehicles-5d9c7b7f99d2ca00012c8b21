The air pressure control lines may not be pressure-protected. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 121, \"Air Brake Systems.\"","consequence":"Without the control line being pressure-protected, in the event the control line is severed, air may suddenly be lost from the service reservoir system, causing the brakes to apply unexpectedly, increasing the risk of a crash.","remedy":"Spartan will notify owners, and dealers will inspect the routing of the control lines, rerouting them into the auxiliary air reservoir as necessary, free of charge. The recall is expected to begin October 10, 2019. Owners may contact Spartan customer service at 1-800-543-5008. Spartan's number for this recall is 19017.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524c8","make":"SPARTAN","model":"GLADIATOR","year":2020},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524c9","make":"SPARTAN","model":"METROSTAR","year":2020},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524ca","make":"SPARTAN","model":"GLADIATOR","year":2019},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524cb","make":"SPARTAN","model":"METROSTAR","year":2019},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524cc","make":"SPARTAN","model":"GLADIATOR","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524cd","make":"SPARTAN","model":"METROSTAR","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524ce","make":"SPARTAN","model":"GLADIATOR","year":2017},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524cf","make":"SPARTAN","model":"METROSTAR","year":2017},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524d0","make":"SPARTAN","model":"GLADIATOR","year":2016},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524d1","make":"SPARTAN","model":"METROSTAR","year":2016},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524d2","make":"SPARTAN","model":"GLADIATOR","year":2015},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524d3","make":"SPARTAN","model":"METROSTAR","year":2015},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524d4","make":"SPARTAN","model":"GLADIATOR","year":2014},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524d5","make":"SPARTAN","model":"METROSTAR","year":2014},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524d6","make":"SPARTAN","model":"GLADIATOR","year":2013},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524d7","make":"SPARTAN","model":"METROSTAR","year":2013},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524d8","make":"SPARTAN","model":"GLADIATOR","year":2012},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524d9","make":"SPARTAN","model":"METROSTAR","year":2012},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524da","make":"SPARTAN","model":"GLADIATOR","year":2011},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524db","make":"SPARTAN","model":"METROSTAR","year":2011},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524dc","make":"SPARTAN","model":"GLADIATOR","year":2010},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524dd","make":"SPARTAN","model":"METROSTAR","year":2010},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524de","make":"SPARTAN","model":"GLADIATOR","year":2009},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524df","make":"SPARTAN","model":"METROSTAR","year":2009},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524e0","make":"SPARTAN","model":"GLADIATOR","year":2008},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524e1","make":"SPARTAN","model":"METROSTAR","year":2008},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524e2","make":"SPARTAN","model":"GLADIATOR","year":2007},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524e3","make":"SPARTAN","model":"METROSTAR","year":2007},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524e4","make":"SPARTAN","model":"GLADIATOR","year":2006},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524e5","make":"SPARTAN","model":"METROSTAR","year":2006},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524e6","make":"SPARTAN","model":"GLADIATOR","year":2005},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524e7","make":"SPARTAN","model":"METROSTAR","year":2005},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524e8","make":"SPARTAN","model":"GLADIATOR","year":2004},{"id":"5d9e69058b079e002a2524e9","make":"SPARTAN","model":"METROSTAR","year":2004}]}}}
