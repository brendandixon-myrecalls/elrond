These vehicles were equipped with Non-Azide Driver air bag Inflators (NADI) and do not contain phase stabilized ammonium nitrate (PSAN) propellant. Due to a manufacturing issue, the NADI inflators may absorb moisture, causing the inflators to rupture or the air bag cushion to underinflate.","consequence":"In the event of a crash necessitating air bag deployment, an inflator rupture may result in metal fragments striking the driver or other occupants. An underinflated air bag cushion may not properly protect the occupant. These scenarios increase the risk of serious injury or death.","remedy":"Honda will notify owners, and dealers will replace the driver frontal air bag inflator with an inflator of a different design, when the replacement parts become available. Owners will be notified of the issue beginning March 9, 2020. A second letter will be mailed once remedy parts become available. Owners may contact American Honda's Customer Support \u0026amp; Campaign Center at 1-888-234-2138 or Isuzu customer service at 1-866-441-9638.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d98c","make":"ACURA","model":"CL","year":2001},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d98d","make":"ACURA","model":"MDX","year":2001},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d98e","make":"ACURA","model":"RL","year":2000},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d98f","make":"ACURA","model":"TL","year":2000},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d990","make":"HONDA","model":"ACCORD","year":2000},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d991","make":"HONDA","model":"CIVIC","year":2000},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d992","make":"HONDA","model":"CR-V","year":2000},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d993","make":"HONDA","model":"ODYSSEY","year":2000},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d994","make":"ACURA","model":"CL","year":1999},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d995","make":"ACURA","model":"RL","year":1999},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d996","make":"ACURA","model":"TL","year":1999},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d997","make":"HONDA","model":"ACCORD","year":1999},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d998","make":"HONDA","model":"CIVIC","year":1999},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d999","make":"HONDA","model":"CR-V","year":1999},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d99a","make":"HONDA","model":"ODYSSEY","year":1999},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d99b","make":"ISUZU","model":"OASIS","year":1999},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d99c","make":"ACURA","model":"CL","year":1998},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d99d","make":"ACURA","model":"RL","year":1998},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d99e","make":"HONDA","model":"ACCORD","year":1998},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d99f","make":"HONDA","model":"CIVIC","year":1998},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d9a0","make":"HONDA","model":"CR-V","year":1998},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d9a1","make":"HONDA","model":"EV PLUS","year":1998},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d9a2","make":"HONDA","model":"ODYSSEY","year":1998},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d9a3","make":"ISUZU","model":"OASIS","year":1998},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d9a4","make":"ACURA","model":"CL","year":1997},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d9a5","make":"HONDA","model":"CIVIC","year":1997},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d9a6","make":"HONDA","model":"CR-V","year":1997},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d9a7","make":"HONDA","model":"EV PLUS","year":1997},{"id":"5e284a8b3c2b4a000115d9a8","make":"HONDA","model":"CIVIC","year":1996}]}}}
