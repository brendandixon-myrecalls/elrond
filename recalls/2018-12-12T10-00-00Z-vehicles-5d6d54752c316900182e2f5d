As built, one of the emergency exit windows may not be able to be easily used in the event of an emergency. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 217, \"Bus Emergency Exits and Window Retention and Release.\"","consequence":"An obstructed emergency exit can hinder passengers from vacating the bus in the event of an emergency, increasing the risk of injury.","remedy":"Gillig will notify owners, and dealers will move one of the emergency exit windows to an unobstructed location, free of charge. The recall began February 22, 2019.
