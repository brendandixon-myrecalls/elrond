The seat recliner mechanisms may be missing the third pawl required for seat back strength, resulting in a loose seat back. These vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) numbers 202, \"Head Restraints\" and 207, \"Seating Systems.\"","consequence":"Improperly assembled recliner mechanism may have reduced strength and may not adequately restrain an occupant in a crash, increasing the risk of injury.","remedy":"Ford has notified TMC owners, and Ford dealers will inspect the seat structures and replace them, as necessary, free of charge. The recall began October 21, 2019. Owners may contact Ford customer service at 1-866-436-7332 or TMC customer service at 1-877-855-2867. TMC's number for this recall is RC000178.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5dd7d0f7208e61000103fe5b","make":"THOR","model":"MAGNITUDE","year":2020},{"id":"5dd7d0f7208e61000103fe5c","make":"THOR","model":"OMNI","year":2020},{"id":"5dd7d0f7208e61000103fe5d","make":"THOR","model":"MAGNITUDE","year":2019},{"id":"5dd7d0f7208e61000103fe5e","make":"THOR","model":"OMNI","year":2019}]}}}
