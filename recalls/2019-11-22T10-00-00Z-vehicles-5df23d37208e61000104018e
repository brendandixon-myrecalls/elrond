(Transportation Collaborative) is recalling certain 2019-2020 TransTech CST and SST school buses equipped with Safe Fleet Prolo hatches. Due to a manufacturing issue, the roof hatch external handle may unexpectedly break under reasonable use. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 217, \"Bus Emergency Exits and Window Retention and Release.\"","consequence":"If the roof hatch external handle breaks, in the event of an emergency, the hatch cannot be easily opened from outside the vehicle, increasing the risk of injury.","remedy":"Transportation Collaborative will notify owners, and Safe Fleet dealers will replace the outer handle, free of charge. The recall is expected to begin in December 2019. Owners may contact Transportation Collaborative customer service at 1-845-988-0419.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5df23d37208e61000104018f","make":"TRANS TECH","model":"CST","year":2020},{"id":"5df23d37208e610001040190","make":"TRANS TECH","model":"SST","year":2020},{"id":"5df23d37208e610001040191","make":"TRANS TECH","model":"CST","year":2019},{"id":"5df23d37208e610001040192","make":"TRANS TECH","model":"SST","year":2019}]}}}
