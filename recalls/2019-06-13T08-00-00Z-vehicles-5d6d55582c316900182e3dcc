(Erwin Hymer) is recalling 2013-2019 Roadtrek E-Trek, RS Adventurous, CS Adventurous, and TS Adventurous motorhomes built on Sprinter chassis and equipped with one or two second row captain's chairs, with integrated seat belts. The seat pedestal base anchor brackets to the chassis fame may not have enough strength to prevent the seat and seat belt from moving in the event of a crash. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 210, \"Seat Belt Assembly Anchorages\" and 207, \"Seating Systems.\"","consequence":"In the event of a crash, the second-row captain seats may not provide adequate protection for occupants, increasing their risk of injury.","remedy":"Erwin Hymer issued owners an interim notification on June 26, 2019. Owners may contact Erwin Hymer customer service at 1-844-464-3735. Erwin Hymer's number for this recall is 2019-01.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251da9","make":"ROADTREK","model":"CS ADVENTUROUS","year":2019},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251daa","make":"ROADTREK","model":"E-TREK","year":2019},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251dab","make":"ROADTREK","model":"RS ADVENTUROUS","year":2019},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251dac","make":"ROADTREK","model":"CS ADVENTUROUS","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251dad","make":"ROADTREK","model":"E-TREK","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251dae","make":"ROADTREK","model":"RS ADVENTUROUS","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251daf","make":"ROADTREK","model":"CS ADVENTUROUS","year":2017},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251db0","make":"ROADTREK","model":"E-TREK","year":2017},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251db1","make":"ROADTREK","model":"RS ADVENTUROUS","year":2017},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251db2","make":"ROADTREK","model":"CS ADVENTUROUS","year":2016},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251db3","make":"ROADTREK","model":"E-TREK","year":2016},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251db4","make":"ROADTREK","model":"RS ADVENTUROUS","year":2016},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251db5","make":"ROADTREK","model":"TS ADVENTUROUS","year":2016},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251db6","make":"ROADTREK","model":"CS ADVENTUROUS","year":2015},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251db7","make":"ROADTREK","model":"E-TREK","year":2015},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251db8","make":"ROADTREK","model":"RS ADVENTUROUS","year":2015},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251db9","make":"ROADTREK","model":"TS ADVENTUROUS","year":2015},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251dba","make":"ROADTREK","model":"CS ADVENTUROUS","year":2014},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251dbb","make":"ROADTREK","model":"E-TREK","year":2014},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251dbc","make":"ROADTREK","model":"RS ADVENTUROUS","year":2014},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251dbd","make":"ROADTREK","model":"TS ADVENTUROUS","year":2014},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251dbe","make":"ROADTREK","model":"CS ADVENTUROUS","year":2013},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251dbf","make":"ROADTREK","model":"E-TREK","year":2013},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251dc0","make":"ROADTREK","model":"RS ADVENTUROUS","year":2013},{"id":"5d9e68d88b079e002a251dc1","make":"ROADTREK","model":"TS ADVENTUROUS","year":2013}]}}}
