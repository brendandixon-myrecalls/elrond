These trailers were built with an under ride guard compliant for a wheels back trailer configuration, however, due to the customers design changes, the wheel set was moved forward and the vehicles no longer meet the definition of a wheels back trailer. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 223, \"Rear Impact Guards,\" and 224, \"Rear Impact Protection.\"","consequence":"The incorrect rear impact guards may not adequately reduce the possibility of a car traveling under the trailer in the event of a crash, increasing the risk of injury to the car driver.","remedy":"Fontaine will notify owners, and dealers will remove the C-channel style horizontal member and replace it with a 4-inch tube and reinforcement gusset, free of charge. The recall began September 14, 2018. Owners may contact Fontaine customer service at 1-877-345-9526.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e688c8b079e002a250c24","make":"FONTAINE","model":"INFINITY","year":2019}]}}}
