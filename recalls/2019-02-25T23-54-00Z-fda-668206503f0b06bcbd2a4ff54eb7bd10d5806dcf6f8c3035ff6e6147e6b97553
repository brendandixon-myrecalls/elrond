Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.","link":"https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/southern-specialties-voluntarily-recalls-bagged-green-beans-and-butternut-squash-distributed","publicationDate":"2019-02-25T23:54:00.000Z","state":"sent","affected":[],"allergens":[],"audience":["consumers"],"categories":["food"],"contaminants":["listeria"],"distribution":["AL","FL","GA","KY","MS","NC","SC","TN","VA"],"risk":"possible","token":"5d9e68b38b079e002a2515a3"}}}
