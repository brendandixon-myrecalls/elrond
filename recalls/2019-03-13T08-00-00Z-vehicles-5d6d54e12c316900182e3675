(TCI) is recalling certain 2015 and 2017 Transtech Buses equipped with Ricon S-Series and K-Series wheel chair lifts. The wheelchair lift positioning input cam may fail while the lift is in use, allowing the platform to travel higher than the vehicle's floor height. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 403, \"Platform Lift Systems.\"","consequence":"If the wheelchair lift platform stops above the vehicle floor, the wheelchair user can tip inwards toward the vehicle when exiting the lift, increasing their risk of injury.","remedy":"TCI will notify owners and Ricon dealers will replace the lift positioning input cam, free of charge. The recall began April 24, 2019. Owners may contact TCI customer service at 1-845-988-0419. Transportation Collaborative's number for this recall is 18E-044.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68b98b079e002a251767","make":"TRANS TECH","model":"CST","year":2017},{"id":"5d9e68b98b079e002a251768","make":"TRANS TECH","model":"CST","year":2015}]}}}
