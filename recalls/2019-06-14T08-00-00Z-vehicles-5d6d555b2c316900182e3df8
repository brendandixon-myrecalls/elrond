(Caterpillar) is recalling certain 2015-2019 Progress Rail 75HRT SkyTrim Hi-Rail vehicles. The boom cradle includes a support plate that may block the driver's visibility.

The detachment of the boom and cradle may become a road hazard, increasing the risk of crash.","remedy":"Caterpillar will notify owners, and Progress Rail dealers will relocate the boom cradle to provide visibility for the driver, and revise the boom hydraulic circuit to prevent an inadvertent boom in the event of a hose failure or leak. These repairs will be performed free of charge. The manufacturer has not yet provided a notification schedule.
