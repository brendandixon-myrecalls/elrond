The tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) sensors use the incorrect wireless radio frequency and cannot illuminate the low pressure warning light when the tire pressure drops below the recommended level. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 138, \"Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems.\"","consequence":"Drivers may drive the vehicle with low tire pressure without a low tire pressure warning, negatively impacting the vehicle handling and increasing the risk of a crash.","remedy":"GM will notify owners, and dealers will replace all four TPMS sensors with the correct sensors, free of charge. The manufacturer has not yet provided a notification schedule. Owners may contact GM customer service at 1-586-596-1733. GM's number for this recall is N192279200.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5db85ad8fbb82300012fa0dd","make":"CADILLAC","model":"CT6","year":2020}]}}}
