(Isuzu) is recalling certain 2019 Isuzu NPR-HD, NPR-XD, NQR, NRR, Chevrolet 4500HD, 4500XD, 5500HD, and 5500XD. The odometer accurately measures the distance traveled in miles, but erroneously indicates that they are kilometers in the LCD display instead of miles.","consequence":"An incorrect odometer reading could lead to an unintended delay in critical safety related maintenance, potentially impairing the safe operation of the vehicle and increasing the risk of a crash.","remedy":"Isuzu will notify customers and dealers to inspect the odometer LCD on their vehicle. If the distance traveled is listed as 'mi' (miles), the customer or dealer will be requested to inform Isuzu and the recall for that vehicle will be deemed complete. If the distance is listed as 'km' (kilometers), the customer will be requested to take the vehicle to the dealer, and the dealer will replace the meter cluster with one that indicates 'mi' (miles). The new odometer will be reprogrammed to reflect the number of miles traveled that was indicated on the original odometer. The recall began March 13, 2019. Isuzu owners may contact Isuzu customer service at 1-866-441-9638, GM owners may contact GM customer service at 1-800-862-4389.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68af8b079e002a2514aa","make":"CHEVROLET","model":"LOW CAB FORWARD 4500","year":2019},{"id":"5d9e68af8b079e002a2514ab","make":"CHEVROLET","model":"LOW CAB FORWARD 5500","year":2019},{"id":"5d9e68af8b079e002a2514ac","make":"ISUZU","model":"NPR HD","year":2019},{"id":"5d9e68af8b079e002a2514ad","make":"ISUZU","model":"NPR XD","year":2019},{"id":"5d9e68af8b079e002a2514ae","make":"ISUZU","model":"NQR","year":2019},{"id":"5d9e68af8b079e002a2514af","make":"ISUZU","model":"NRR","year":2019}]}}}
