(Ameritrans) is recalling certain 2013-2016 Ameritrans Ram 5500 (R Series) vehicles. Pushing the brake pedal for prolonged periods when the vehicle is running and in PARK may cause the Brake Transmission Shift Interlock (BTSI) pin to stick in the open position. With the pin in the open position, the transmission can be shifted out of PARK into any gear without pushing the brake pedal or having the key in the ignition.","consequence":"Being able to shift the transmission without pushing the brake pedal and/or without a key in the ignition can increase the risk of an unintended vehicle rollaway that may result in personal injury or a crash.","remedy":"Ameritrans has notified owners and Chrysler dealers will update the vehicle software, inspect the BTSI, and, as necessary, replace it, free of charge. The recall began July 23, 2019. Owners may contact Ameritrans customer service at 1-574-218-4786.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68e48b079e002a2520ae","make":"AMERITRANS","model":"5500","year":2016},{"id":"5d9e68e48b079e002a2520af","make":"AMERITRANS","model":"5500","year":2015},{"id":"5d9e68e48b079e002a2520b0","make":"AMERITRANS","model":"5500","year":2014},{"id":"5d9e68e48b079e002a2520b1","make":"AMERITRANS","model":"5500","year":2013}]}}}
