The bayonet lock between the fuel pump and the fuel tank may not have been closed and locked during manufacturing. As a result, a leak between the fuel pump and the fuel tank could occur. In addition, a gas station fuel pump may not automatically stop once the tank fill level is reached, potentially causing the fuel to overflow.","consequence":"A diesel fuel leak can create slippery road conditions, increasing the risk of a crash.","remedy":"DVUSA will notify owners, and dealers will inspect the bayonet lock on the fuel pump, locking it as necessary, free of charge. The recall is expected to begin December 20, 2019. Owners may contact DVUSA customer service at 1-877-762-8267. DVUSA's number for this recall is VS3KRAFMOD.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5de25cfd208e6100010400a6","make":"FREIGHTLINER","model":"SPRINTER 1500","year":2019},{"id":"5de25cfd208e6100010400a7","make":"FREIGHTLINER","model":"SPRINTER 2500","year":2019},{"id":"5de25cfd208e6100010400a8","make":"FREIGHTLINER","model":"SPRINTER 3500","year":2019},{"id":"5de25cfd208e6100010400a9","make":"FREIGHTLINER","model":"SPRINTER 4500","year":2019},{"id":"5de25cfd208e6100010400aa","make":"MERCEDES BENZ","model":"SPRINTER 1500","year":2019},{"id":"5de25cfd208e6100010400ab","make":"MERCEDES BENZ","model":"SPRINTER 2500","year":2019},{"id":"5de25cfd208e6100010400ac","make":"MERCEDES BENZ","model":"SPRINTER 3500","year":2019},{"id":"5de25cfd208e6100010400ad","make":"MERCEDES BENZ","model":"SPRINTER 4500","year":2019}]}}}
