When the back seat cushion is rotated from the stowed position to the upright position, the seat cushion may not remain locked into place when under load, such as in a crash or a sudden stop. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 207, \"Seating Systems,\" and number 210, \"Seat Belt Assembly Anchorages.\"","consequence":"In the event of a crash, if the seat back moves, the seat occupant has an increased risk of injury.","remedy":"Diamond Coach will notify owners, and dealers will inspect and repair the foldaway seat, free of charge. The recall began April 3, 2019. Owners may contact Diamond Coach customer service at 1-800-442-4645.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68b58b079e002a251629","make":"DIAMOND COACH","model":"PT 2000","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e68b58b079e002a25162a","make":"DIAMOND COACH TRANSIT","model":"MPV/VTUM","year":2018}]}}}
