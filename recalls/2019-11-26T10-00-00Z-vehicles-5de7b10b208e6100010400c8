These inflators do not contain phase stabilized ammonium nitrate (PSAN) propellant. Due to a manufacturing issue, the NADI inflators may absorb moisture, causing the inflators to rupture or the air bag cushion to underinflate.","consequence":"In the event of a crash necessitating air bag deployment, an inflator rupture may result in metal fragments striking the driver or other occupants. An underinflated air bag may not properly protect the occupant. These scenarios increase the risk of serious injury or death.","remedy":"BMW will mail interim notices informing owners of the safety risk on January 17, 2020. Owners will receive a second notice when the remedy becomes available. Dealers will inspect the driver air bag inflators and replace them, as necessary, free of charge. Owners may contact BMW customer service at 1-800-525-7417.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5de7b10b208e6100010400c9","make":"BMW","model":"323CI","year":2000},{"id":"5de7b10b208e6100010400ca","make":"BMW","model":"323I","year":2000},{"id":"5de7b10b208e6100010400cb","make":"BMW","model":"328CI","year":2000},{"id":"5de7b10b208e6100010400cc","make":"BMW","model":"328I","year":2000},{"id":"5de7b10b208e6100010400cd","make":"BMW","model":"323I","year":1999},{"id":"5de7b10b208e6100010400ce","make":"BMW","model":"328I","year":1999}]}}}
