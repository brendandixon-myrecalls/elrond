The fuel-level sensor in the front tank may stick in a low-level position, allowing the rear tank to overfill the front tank.","consequence":"If the front tank overfills, the excess pressure may cause the front tank to expand and contact the driveshaft, possibly resulting in a hole in the tank. The hole will leak fuel, which in the presence of an ignition source, can increase the risk of a fire.","remedy":"GM has notified owners, and dealers will replace the rear-tank fuel-pump module, inspect the front tank and, if necessary, replace the front tank, free of charge. The recall began July 30, 2019. GM's number for this recall is N182204190.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68af8b079e002a25149c","make":"CHEVROLET","model":"SILVERADO 3500","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e68af8b079e002a25149d","make":"GMC","model":"SIERRA 3500","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e68af8b079e002a25149e","make":"CHEVROLET","model":"SILVERADO 3500","year":2017},{"id":"5d9e68af8b079e002a25149f","make":"GMC","model":"SIERRA 3500","year":2017},{"id":"5d9e68af8b079e002a2514a0","make":"CHEVROLET","model":"SILVERADO 3500","year":2016},{"id":"5d9e68af8b079e002a2514a1","make":"GMC","model":"SIERRA 3500","year":2016}]}}}
