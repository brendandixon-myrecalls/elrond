The inline electrical connector terminals for the rear lights may be misaligned or not properly seated, potentially causing the rear lights to function intermittently or not at all.","consequence":"Intermittent or inoperative tail lamps can result in loss of stop, turn, rear position, and reverse lamp functions, which reduces the vehicle's visibility and may not fully alert other drivers that the vehicle is braking, turning, or reversing, increasing the risk of crash.","remedy":"Ford will notify owners, and dealers will inspect the inline connector for loose terminals and replace the connectors, if necessary, free of charge. The recall is expected to begin January 6, 2020. Owners may contact Ford customer service at 1-866-436-7332. Ford's number for this recall is 19S43.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5ddfb9fb208e610001040069","make":"FORD","model":"RANGER","year":2019}]}}}
