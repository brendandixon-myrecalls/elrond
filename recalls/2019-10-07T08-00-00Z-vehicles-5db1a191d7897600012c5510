The ABS Electronic Control Unit (ECU) may not detect an incorrectly functioning solenoid valve for the ABS/ESC module during certain low voltage start conditions, potentially causing the ABS/ESC Malfunction indicator not to illuminate. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 121, \"Air Brake Systems\" and number 136, \"Electronic Stability Control Systems on Heavy Vehicles.\"","consequence":"Without the alert, an operator may not be aware of an active ABS/ESC malfunction and unknowingly operate the vehicle with reduced ABS/ESC function, increasing the risk of a crash.","remedy":"DTNA will notify owners, and dealers will reprogram the ABS/ESC module, free of charge. The recall is expected to begin December 2, 2019. Owners may contact DTNA customer service at 1-800-547-0712. DTNA's number for this recall is FL-830.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5db1a191d7897600012c5511","make":"FREIGHTLINER","model":"CASCADIA","year":2020},{"id":"5db1a191d7897600012c5512","make":"FREIGHTLINER","model":"CASCADIA","year":2019},{"id":"5db1a191d7897600012c5513","make":"FREIGHTLINER","model":"CASCADIA","year":2018}]}}}
