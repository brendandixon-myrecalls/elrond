When the back seat cushion is rotated from the stowed position to the upright position, the seat cushion may not remain locked into place when under load, such as in a crash or a sudden stop. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 207, \"Seating Systems,\" and number 210, \"Seat Belt Assembly Anchorages.\"","consequence":"In the event of a crash, if the seat back moves, the seat occupant has an increased risk of injury.","remedy":"Eldorado National California has notified owners, and dealers will inspect and repair the affected seats, free of charge. The recall began on January 31, 2019. Owners may contact Eldorado National-California Customer Service at 1-909-591-9557 or Freedman Seating Company at 1-800-443-4540.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68a58b079e002a251147","make":"ELDORADO","model":"ARRIVO","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e68a58b079e002a251148","make":"ELDORADO","model":"E-Z RIDER MAX BRT","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e68a58b079e002a251149","make":"ELDORADO","model":"PASSPORT","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e68a58b079e002a25114a","make":"ELDORADO","model":"ARRIVO","year":2017},{"id":"5d9e68a58b079e002a25114b","make":"ELDORADO","model":"E-Z RIDER MAX BRT","year":2017},{"id":"5d9e68a58b079e002a25114c","make":"ELDORADO","model":"PASSPORT","year":2017}]}}}
