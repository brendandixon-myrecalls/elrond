(Ferrari) is recalling certain 2009-2011 California and 2010-2011 458 Italia vehicles equipped with non-desiccated, passenger frontal air bag inflators containing phase stabilized ammonium nitrate (PSAN) propellant that were used as interim remedy parts for previous Takata recalls. These inflators may explode due to propellant degradation occurring after long-term exposure to high absolute humidity, high temperatures, and high temperature cycling.","consequence":"An inflator explosion may result in sharp metal fragments striking the driver or other occupants resulting in serious injury or death.","remedy":"Ferrari will notify owners, and dealers will replace the front passenger air bag assembly with an alternate one, including a new non-ammonium nitrate inflator, free of charge. The manufacturer has not yet provided a notification schedule. Owners may contact Ferrari customer service at 1-201-816-2668. Ferrari's number for this recall is 60FL.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5e1db07a3c2b4a000115d7f9","make":"FERRARI","model":"458 ITALIA","year":2011},{"id":"5e1db07a3c2b4a000115d7fa","make":"FERRARI","model":"CALIFORNIA","year":2011},{"id":"5e1db07a3c2b4a000115d7fb","make":"FERRARI","model":"458 ITALIA","year":2010},{"id":"5e1db07a3c2b4a000115d7fc","make":"FERRARI","model":"CALIFORNIA","year":2010},{"id":"5e1db07a3c2b4a000115d7fd","make":"FERRARI","model":"CALIFORNIA","year":2009}]}}}
