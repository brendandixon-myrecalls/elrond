The seatbelt harness connector which connects the Seatbelt Tension Sensor (STS) to the Occupant Classification Sensor Control Module (OCSCM) may not have been correctly wired. As a result, the Restraint Control Module (RCM) may not accurately detect if an adult or child is occupying the seat.","consequence":"In the event of a crash necessitating air bag deployment, an incorrect classification may result in the passenger frontal air bag deploying even if there is a child in the front passenger seat, increasing their risk of injury.","remedy":"Jaguar will notify owners, and dealers will inspect the seat belt assembly and repair the seatbelt tension sensor harness as necessary, free of charge. The recall began June 3, 2019. Owners may contact Jaguar customer service at 1-800-452-4827. Jaguar's number for this recall is H208.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68c78b079e002a251a52","make":"JAGUAR","model":"F-TYPE","year":2015},{"id":"5d9e68c78b079e002a251a53","make":"JAGUAR","model":"F-TYPE","year":2014}]}}}
