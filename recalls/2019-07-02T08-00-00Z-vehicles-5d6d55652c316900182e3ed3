The t-bolt clasps on the transmission auxiliary air tank straps may have been over-tightened, resulting in potential deformation to the strap where the t-bolt is anchored.","consequence":"The deformation of the air tank strap t-bolts may cause the t-bolt to disconnect from the strap allowing the tank to drop to the ground and become a road hazard, increasing the risk of a crash.","remedy":"Volvo Trucks will notify owners, and dealers will inspect and replace the air tank strap, if necessary, free of charge. The recall began August 7, 2019. Owners may contact Volvo Trucks customer service at 1-800-528-6586. Volvo Truck's number for this recall is RVXX1904.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68e18b079e002a252006","make":"VOLVO","model":"VAH","year":2020},{"id":"5d9e68e18b079e002a252007","make":"VOLVO","model":"VHD","year":2020},{"id":"5d9e68e18b079e002a252008","make":"VOLVO","model":"VNL","year":2020},{"id":"5d9e68e18b079e002a252009","make":"VOLVO","model":"VNR","year":2020},{"id":"5d9e68e18b079e002a25200a","make":"VOLVO","model":"VAH","year":2019},{"id":"5d9e68e18b079e002a25200b","make":"VOLVO","model":"VHD","year":2019},{"id":"5d9e68e18b079e002a25200c","make":"VOLVO","model":"VNL","year":2019},{"id":"5d9e68e18b079e002a25200d","make":"VOLVO","model":"VNR","year":2019}]}}}
