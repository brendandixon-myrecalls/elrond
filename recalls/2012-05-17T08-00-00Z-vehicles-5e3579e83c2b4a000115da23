In May 2012, Honda filed a defect report to recall certain model year 2007 and 2008 Acura TL vehicles. In September 2012, Honda informed the agency that it was including an additional 573,147 vehicles including certain model year 2003 through 2007 Accord V6 vehicles. The total number of vehicles being recalled is now 625,762. Prolonged under-hood and power steering fluid temperatures may cause the power steering hose to deteriorate prematurely, resulting in cracks and power steering fluid leakage.","consequence":"If this occurs, power steering fluid can leak onto a hot catalytic converter, leading to smoke and possibly an under-hood fire.","remedy":"Honda will notify owners, and dealers will install a new heat resistant power steering hose, free of charge. The original recall began in June 2012, and owners of those vehicles may obtain the free remedy. Sufficient parts are not yet available for owners of the vehicles covered by the September 2012 expansion, but are expected to be available in early 2013. Honda will notify owners of these vehicles beginning on October 26, 2012, and will notify these owners again when parts are available so those vehicles can be brought to dealers for applications of the free remedy. Owners may contact Honda customer service at 1-800-999-1009.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5e3579e83c2b4a000115da24","make":"ACURA","model":"TL","year":2008},{"id":"5e3579e83c2b4a000115da25","make":"ACURA","model":"TL","year":2007},{"id":"5e3579e83c2b4a000115da26","make":"HONDA","model":"ACCORD","year":2007},{"id":"5e3579e83c2b4a000115da27","make":"HONDA","model":"ACCORD","year":2006},{"id":"5e3579e83c2b4a000115da28","make":"HONDA","model":"ACCORD","year":2005},{"id":"5e3579e83c2b4a000115da29","make":"HONDA","model":"ACCORD","year":2004},{"id":"5e3579e83c2b4a000115da2a","make":"HONDA","model":"ACCORD","year":2003}]}}}
