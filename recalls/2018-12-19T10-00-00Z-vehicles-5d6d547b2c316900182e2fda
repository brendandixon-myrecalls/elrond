(Nissan) is recalling certain 2015-2017 Altima vehicles, previously remedied under recall number 17V-040. The door latch-lock cable may not have been routed properly in the rear door when the remedy was applied. As a result, the cable may interfere with the window regulator causing the rear passenger door to unlatch and inadvertently open without warning when the window is lowered.","consequence":"If the rear passenger door opens while the vehicle is moving, the rear passengers have an increased risk of injury.","remedy":"Nissan will notify owners, and dealers will secure the latch-lock cables in the correct position using the new remedy procedure, free of charge. The recall began February 5, 2019. Owners may contact Nissan customer service at 1-800-647-7669.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68a58b079e002a25117a","make":"NISSAN","model":"ALTIMA","year":2017},{"id":"5d9e68a58b079e002a25117b","make":"NISSAN","model":"ALTIMA","year":2016},{"id":"5d9e68a58b079e002a25117c","make":"NISSAN","model":"ALTIMA","year":2015}]}}}
