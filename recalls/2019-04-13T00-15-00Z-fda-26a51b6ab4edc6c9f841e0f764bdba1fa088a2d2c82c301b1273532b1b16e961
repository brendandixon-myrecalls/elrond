Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.","link":"https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/caito-foods-llc-voluntarily-recalls-fresh-cut-melon-product-because-possible-health-risk","publicationDate":"2019-04-13T00:15:00.000Z","state":"sent","affected":[],"allergens":[],"audience":["consumers"],"categories":["food"],"contaminants":["salmonella"],"distribution":["IA","IL","IN","KS","KY","MI","MN","MO","NC","NE","NY","OH","PA","TN","WV","WI"],"risk":"probable","token":"5d9e68c48b079e002a2519be"}}}
