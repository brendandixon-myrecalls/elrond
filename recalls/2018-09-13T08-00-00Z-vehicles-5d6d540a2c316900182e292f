The wiring harness may have been inappropriately installed, potentially resulting in damage to the wiring harness and affecting the operation of safety components such as the exterior lighting, horn, and instrument panel. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 108, \"Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment,\" and 123, \"Motorcycle Control Displays.\"","consequence":"Lack of exterior lights can reduce the visibility of the motorcycle to traffic. A non-functioning horn can cause the inability to alert traffic of an impending crash, and a non-functioning instrument panel will not display the speed or fuel level. A damaged wiring harness can also result in an engine stall, increasing the risk of a crash.","remedy":"Honda will notify owners, and dealers will inspect the wiring harness, replacing it as necessary, free of charge. The recall began October 31, 2018. Owners may contact Honda customer service at 1-866-784-1870. Honda's number for this recall is KJ7.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68898b079e002a250afc","make":"HONDA","model":"CRF250L","year":2018}]}}}
