(Lotus) is recalling certain 2017-2018 Evora vehicles. The toe board in the passenger footwell lacks stiffness, allowing the knee of an unbelted occupant to contact the rigid structure of the vehicle, in the event of a crash. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 208, \"Occupant Crash Protection.\"","consequence":"In the event of a crash, if the occupant's knee contacts the rigid structure, there may be an increased risk of injury.","remedy":"Lotus will notify owners, and dealers will replace the toe board with a new design to provide the appropriate stiffness, free of charge. The recall began May 27, 2019. Owners may contact Lotus customer service at 1-800-245-6887. Lotus' number for this recall is 2019/01R.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68c18b079e002a2518d3","make":"LOTUS","model":"EVORA","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e68c18b079e002a2518d4","make":"LOTUS","model":"EVORA","year":2017}]}}}
