The brake light switch mounting bracket may have caused the brake light switch to be incorrectly adjusted at installation and/or the brake light switch mounting bracket may deform when the driver allows the brake pedal to return forcibly. An incorrectly adjusted brake light switch or deformed brake light switch mounting bracket may cause the brake lights to illuminate continuously.","consequence":"Improperly functioning brake lights could confuse following motorists and fail to warn them that the bus may be stopping, increasing the risk of a crash.","remedy":"Blue Bird will send owners an interim notification beginning December 17, 2019, and will mail a second letter when parts become available, currently expected to be in March 2020. Dealers will install a new, redesigned brake light switch mounting bracket along with a new brake light switch, free of charge. Owners may contact Blue Bird customer service at 1-478-822-2242.
