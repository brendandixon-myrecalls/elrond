(Polaris) is recalling certain 2018-2019 Slingshot motorcycles. The driver-seat and passenger-seat seat belt and seat back anchoring bracket may have been improperly welded. Additionally, differences in the seat assembly may prevent proper latching of the seat slider, allowing the driver's seat to move unexpectedly.","consequence":"If the seat belt buckle or seat back detach from the seat base, there would be an increased risk of injury in the event of a crash. If the driver's seat unexpectedly moves, it can cause the driver to lose control of the motorcycle, increasing the risk of a crash.","remedy":"Polaris will notify owners, and dealers will inspect the seat belt bracket and seat back welds, and the seat slider latching function. If the weld is missing or incomplete, or if the slider doesn't latch properly, the seat bases will be replaced, free of charge. The recall began April 11, 2019. Owners may contact Polaris customer service at 1-855-863-2284. Polaris' number for this recall is T-18-01.
