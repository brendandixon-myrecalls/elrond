Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.","link":"https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/sprout-creek-farm-recalls-kinkead-cheese-due-possible-health-risk","publicationDate":"2018-11-28T21:06:00.000Z","state":"sent","affected":[],"allergens":[],"audience":["consumers"],"categories":["food"],"contaminants":["listeria"],"distribution":["NY","TX"],"risk":"possible","token":"5d9e689f8b079e002a25106b"}}}
