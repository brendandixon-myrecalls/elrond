The vehicles may have received an incorrect replacement part during the recall remedy. The filler neck check valve may seal the tank too tightly, causing the tank to overpressurize and possibly rupture.","consequence":"If the tank ruptures it may cause hydraulic fluid to spill. The ruptured tank can cause injuries from plastic debris. The spilled hydraulic fluid could be hot which could cause burn injuries. If the vehicle is on the road when the tank ruptures, the tank pieces or spilled hydraulic fluid may cause a road hazard which could increase the risk of a crash.","remedy":"Oshkosh will notify owners, and instruct owners to inspect the vehicle to determine which filler neck was received and installed as part of 18V-322. If found to be incorrect, dealers will replace the filler neck, free of charge. The recall began August 9, 2019. Owners may contact Oshkosh customer service at 1-888-686-7278.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68dc8b079e002a251eb9","make":"MCNEILUS","model":"BRIDGEMASTER V MIXER","year":2018}]}}}
