The back-up camera may fail internally, possibly melting the voltage regulator and blowing the fuse for that circuit, thereby preventing the taillight from functioning properly. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 108, Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment.","consequence":"The melted voltage regulator can increase the risk of a fire. The loss of a tail light can increase the risk of a crash.","remedy":"Polaris will notify owners, and dealers will inspect and replace the back-up camera, as necessary, free of charge. The recall began January 2, 2019. Owners may contact Polaris at 1-855-863-2284. Polaris' number for this recall is T-18-04.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e689b8b079e002a250f92","make":"POLARIS","model":"SLINGSHOT","year":2016},{"id":"5d9e689b8b079e002a250f93","make":"POLARIS","model":"SLINGSHOT","year":2015}]}}}
