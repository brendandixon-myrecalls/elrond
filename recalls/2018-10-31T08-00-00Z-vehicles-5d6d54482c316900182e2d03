(Suzuki) is recalling certain 2010-2013 Suzuki Kizashi vehicles. Dust can enter the vent line that provides fresh air to the carbon canister, restricting its air flow and possibly creating excessive negative pressure in the fuel tank which may result in the fuel tank cracking.","consequence":"A cracked tank may leak fuel, increasing the risk of a fire.","remedy":"Suzuki has sent owners an initial notification to inform them of the recall. When parts are available, a second notice will be mailed and dealers will install a cover over the opening near the suction pipe inlet, and relocate the suction filter. The fuel cap and fuel tank will also be replaced with improved parts. The recall began August 12, 2019. Owners may contact Suzuki customer service at 1-800-934-0934.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68988b079e002a250eb1","make":"SUZUKI","model":"KIZASHI","year":2013},{"id":"5d9e68988b079e002a250eb2","make":"SUZUKI","model":"KIZASHI","year":2012},{"id":"5d9e68988b079e002a250eb3","make":"SUZUKI","model":"KIZASHI","year":2011},{"id":"5d9e68988b079e002a250eb4","make":"SUZUKI","model":"KIZASHI","year":2010}]}}}
