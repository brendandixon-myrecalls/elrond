(MBUSA) is recalling certain 2018-2019 C300, C300 4MATIC, and C43 AMG 4MATIC vehicles. The mounting bracket for the 12-volt battery may not be secured. This may allow the battery to shift, possibly disconnecting the terminals in the event of a crash.","consequence":"Loss of power from the battery can impair post-crash functions, such as communicating with emergency services and activating hazard lights. The battery may also detach and become a road hazard. Either of these scenarios can increase the risk of injury.","remedy":"MBUSA will notify owners, and dealers will replace the battery mounting bracket, free of charge. The recall is expected to begin October 8, 2019. Owners may contact MBUSA customer service at 1-800-367-6372.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68ef8b079e002a252217","make":"MERCEDES BENZ","model":"C300","year":2019},{"id":"5d9e68ef8b079e002a252218","make":"MERCEDES BENZ","model":"C43 AMG","year":2019},{"id":"5d9e68ef8b079e002a252219","make":"MERCEDES BENZ","model":"C300","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e68ef8b079e002a25221a","make":"MERCEDES BENZ","model":"C43 AMG","year":2018}]}}}
