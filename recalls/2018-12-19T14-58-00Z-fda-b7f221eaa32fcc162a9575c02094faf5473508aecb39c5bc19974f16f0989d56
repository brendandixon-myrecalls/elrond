Coli O157:H7). E. coli O157:H7 causes a diarrheal illness often with bloody stools. Although most healthy adults can recover completely within a week, some people can develop a form of kidney failure called Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). HUS is most likely to occur in young children and the elderly. The condition can lead to serious kidney damage and even death.","link":"https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/wegmans-issues-voluntary-recall-fresh-cauliflower-rice-veggiecauliflower-rice-blend-and-stir-fry-mix","publicationDate":"2018-12-19T14:58:00.000Z","state":"sent","affected":[],"allergens":[],"audience":["consumers"],"categories":["food"],"contaminants":["e.coli"],"distribution":["MD","MA","NJ","NY","PA","VA"],"risk":"possible","token":"5d9e68a68b079e002a2511d2"}}}
