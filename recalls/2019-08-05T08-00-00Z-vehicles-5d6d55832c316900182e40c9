The Manual Park Release (MPR) cover may not be installed. In addition, the vehicles may be in Factory Mode, which disables warning alerts and does not display the transmission gear selected. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) numbers 114, \"Theft Prevention\" and 102, \"Trans Shift Lever Seq/Starter Interlock/Trans Braking Effect.\"","consequence":"Without the cover, the MPR lever may be unintentionally moved, allowing the vehicle to roll away. Being in Factory Mode, the vehicle will not display warnings and/or gear selection on the instrument cluster. Both conditions increase the risk of a crash.","remedy":"Ford will notify owners, and dealers will inspect and, if necessary, install a MPR cover. Dealers will verify the instrument cluster is not in Factory Mode and clear any fault codes, free of charge. The recall began August 23, 2019. Owners may contact Ford customer service at 1-866-436-7332. Ford's number for this recall is 19C06.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68ee8b079e002a2521ed","make":"FORD","model":"EXPLORER","year":2020},{"id":"5d9e68ee8b079e002a2521ee","make":"LINCOLN","model":"AVIATOR","year":2020}]}}}
