The affected motorcycles were built with a front/rear split brake system instead of a left/right split brake system. In the event of a front brake system failure, the rear brake system may not allow the vehicle to meet the minimum stopping distance requirements. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with Federal Motor Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 122, \"Motorcycle brake systems.\"","consequence":"If the brakes cannot stop the motorcycle within the distance required, there is an increased risk of a crash.","remedy":"Arcimoto has contacted the owners and will replace the existing brake lines with new brake lines that have an updated design, free of charge. Owners may contact Arcimoto customer service at 1-541-683-6293. Arcimoto's number for this recall is 7F7-P2S8D-12.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68a78b079e002a25123a","make":"ARCIMOTO","model":"FUV","year":2017}]}}}
