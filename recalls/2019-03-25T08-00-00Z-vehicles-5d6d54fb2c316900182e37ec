The clamp for the steering gear return hose may have been improperly installed, allowing the hose to separate from the steering gear.","consequence":"If the hose separates from the steering gear, there may be a loss of steering assist which could result in a potentially disabled school bus. If the school bus is occupied when the steering assist is lost, the occupants would need to exit the vehicle and be transferred to another vehicle, increasing the risk of injury.","remedy":"DTNA will notify owners, and dealers will inspect and install power steering hose clamps as needed, free of charge. The recall began May 10, 2019. Owners may contact DTNA customer service at 1-800-547-0712.
