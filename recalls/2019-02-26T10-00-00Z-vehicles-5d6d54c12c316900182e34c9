The wheelchair lift positioning input cam may fail while the lift is in use, allowing the platform to travel higher than the vehicle's floor height. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 403, \"Platform Lift Systems.\"","consequence":"If the wheelchair lift platform stops above the vehicle floor, the wheelchair user can tip inwards towards the vehicle when exiting the lift, increasing their risk of injury.","remedy":"New England has notified owners, and Ricon dealers will replace the lift positioning input cam, free of charge. The recall began on March 18, 2019. Owners may contact Ricon customer service at 1-800-322-2884 or New England customer service at 1-978-663-9724.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68b48b079e002a2515ad","make":"FORD","model":"E-250","year":2014},{"id":"5d9e68b48b079e002a2515ae","make":"FORD","model":"E-250","year":2013},{"id":"5d9e68b48b079e002a2515af","make":"FORD","model":"E-250","year":2008}]}}}
