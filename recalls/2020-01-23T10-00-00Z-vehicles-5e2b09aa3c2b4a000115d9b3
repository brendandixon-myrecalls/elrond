(MMNA) is recalling certain 1998-2000 Montero vehicles. These vehicles were equipped with Non-Azide Driver air bag Inflators (NADI) and do not contain phase stabilized ammonium nitrate (PSAN) propellant. Due to a manufacturing issue, the NADI inflators may absorb moisture, causing the inflators to rupture or the air bag cushion to underinflate.","consequence":"In the event of a crash necessitating air bag deployment, an inflator rupture may result in metal fragments striking the driver or other occupants. An underinflated air bag may not properly protect the occupant. These scenarios increase the risk of serious injury or death.","remedy":"The remedy for this recall is still under development. The recall is expected to begin March 22, 2020. Owners may contact MMNA customer service at 1-888-648-7820. MMNA's number for this recall is SR-20-001.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5e2b09aa3c2b4a000115d9b4","make":"MITSUBISHI","model":"MONTERO","year":2000},{"id":"5e2b09aa3c2b4a000115d9b5","make":"MITSUBISHI","model":"MONTERO","year":1999},{"id":"5e2b09aa3c2b4a000115d9b6","make":"MITSUBISHI","model":"MONTERO","year":1998}]}}}
