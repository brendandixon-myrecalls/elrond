(MBUSA) is recalling certain 2020 GLE350, GLE350 4MATIC, and GLE450 4MATIC vehicles. The air conditioner drain hoses may have been incorrectly installed, causing water to drain from the air conditioner into the passenger compartment.","consequence":"If a significant volume of water enters the driver and passenger side foot wells, it might cause corrosion and/or short circuits to the electrical components in the area, increasing the risk of fire. In addition, the emergency call (eCall) feature may be disabled; the vehicle may not be able to be unlocked and/or started; and the engine limp-home mode might be activated during driving. These features increase the risk of an injury or crash.","remedy":"MBUSA will notify owners, and dealers will inspect and correct the air conditioner drain hoses, as necessary, free of charge. The recall is expected to begin October 8, 2019. Owners may contact MBUSA customer service at 1-800-367-6372.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68f08b079e002a252234","make":"MERCEDES BENZ","model":"GLE350","year":2020},{"id":"5d9e68f08b079e002a252235","make":"MERCEDES-BENZ","model":"GLE450","year":2020}]}}}
