If a wheel-speed sensor fails, the Electronic-Brake Control Module (EBCM) software may activate the driveline-protection system.","consequence":"Unintended activation of the driveline-protection system will cause unintended braking on the wheel on the opposite side of the failed sensor, causing the vehicle to pull to one side unexpectedly, increasing the risk of a crash.","remedy":"GM will notify owners, and dealers will reprogram the EBCM, free of charge. The manufacturer has not yet provided a notification schedule. Owners may contact Chevrolet customer service at 1-800-630-2438 or GMC customer service at 1-800-462-8782.
