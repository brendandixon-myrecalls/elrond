(Ameritrans) is recalling one 2016 E225 vehicle equipped with a Ricon Wheelchair lift. The wheelchair lift positioning input cam may fail while the lift is in use, allowing the platform to travel higher than the vehicle's floor height. As such, this vehicle fails to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 403, \"Platform Lift Systems.\"","consequence":"If the wheelchair lift platform stops above the vehicle floor, the wheelchair user can tip inwards towards the vehicle when exiting the lift, increasing the risk of injury.","remedy":"Ameritrans will notify the owner and a Ricon dealer will replace the lift positioning input cam, free of charge. The recall began April 26, 2019. Owners may contact Ricon customer service at 1-800-322-2884.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68b68b079e002a251659","make":"AMERITRANS","model":"E225","year":2016}]}}}
