While vitamin D is an essential nutrient for dogs, ingestion of elevated levels can lead to potential health issues depending on the level of vitamin D and the length of exposure, and dogs may exhibit symptoms such as vomiting, loss of appetite, increased thirst, increased urination, excessive drooling, and weight loss. Vitamin D, when consumed at very high levels, can lead to serious health issues in dogs including renal dysfunction. Pet parents with dogs who have consumed any of the products listed and are exhibiting any of these signs should contact their veterinarian. In most cases, complete recovery is expected after discontinuation of feeding.","link":"https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/hills-pet-nutrition-voluntarily-recalls-select-canned-dog-food-excessive-vitamin-d","publicationDate":"2019-01-31T20:52:00.000Z","state":"sent","affected":[],"allergens":[],"audience":["consumers"],"categories":["animals"],"contaminants":[],"distribution":["AK","AL","AR","AZ","CA","CO","CT","DC","DE","FL","GA","HI","IA","ID","IL","IN","KS","KY","LA","MA","MD","ME","MI","MN","MO","MS","MT","NC","ND","NE","NH","NJ","NM","NV","NY","OH","OK","OR","PA","RI","SC","SD","TN","TX","UT","VA","VT","WA","WI","WV","WY"],"risk":"possible","token":"5d9e68ad8b079e002a25147c"}}}
