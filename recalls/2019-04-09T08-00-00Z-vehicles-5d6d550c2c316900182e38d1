(Proterra) is recalling certain 2015-2018 Catalyst 40 buses equipped with an optional tow fitting and airline that allows a tow truck to operate the rear brakes on the vehicle. The mesh cap covering the airline for the tow fitting can be clogged with road debris in inclement weather, possibly resulting in a build up of air pressure in the rear brake system.","consequence":"A build up of air pressure can cause the brakes to drag and possibly overheat, increasing the risk of fire.","remedy":"Proterra will notify owners, and dealers will install an additional shield to the tow fitting that protects the mesh cap, free of charge. The recall began June 4, 2019. Owners may contact Proterra customer service at 1-864-438-0000.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68c28b079e002a25195d","make":"PROTERRA","model":"CATALYST","year":2018},{"id":"5d9e68c28b079e002a25195e","make":"PROTERRA","model":"CATALYST","year":2017},{"id":"5d9e68c28b079e002a25195f","make":"PROTERRA","model":"CATALYST","year":2016},{"id":"5d9e68c28b079e002a251960","make":"PROTERRA","model":"CATALYST","year":2015}]}}}
