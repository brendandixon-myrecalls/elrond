(Jayco) is recalling certain 2019-2020 Redhawk SE motorhomes. The seatbelt-unfastened warning light will not illuminate for approximately five seconds after the ignition is moved to the \"on\" or \"start\" position. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 208, \"Occupant Crash Protection.\"","consequence":"Without the seatbelt warning reminder, the driver may forget to fasten the seatbelt, increasing the risk of injury in the event of a crash.","remedy":"GM will notify owners, and dealers will reprogram the instrument panel cluster, free of charge.
