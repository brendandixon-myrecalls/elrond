(MBUSA) is recalling certain 2019 CLS 450 Coupe and CLS 450 Coupe 4MATIC vehicles equipped with 6-cylinder gasoline engines. The electrical line that supplies power to the engine coolant pump may contact the engine fan and chafe, possibly causing a malfunction of the coolant pump or a deactivation of the 48V on-board electrical system.","consequence":"A malfunctioning engine coolant pump can increase coolant temperatures, possibly leading to an engine stall. Deactivation of the 48V on-board electrical system can cause the vehicle to not restart after using the ECO start/stop function or \"Glide\" mode. Either of these scenarios can increase the risk of a crash.","remedy":"MBUSA will notify owners, and dealers will inspect the coolant pump electrical line for damage, repairing it and rerouting it as necessary, free of charge. The recall is expected to begin October 15, 2019. Owners may contact MBUSA customer service at 1-800-367-6372.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68f28b079e002a252277","make":"MERCEDES BENZ","model":"CLS450","year":2019}]}}}
