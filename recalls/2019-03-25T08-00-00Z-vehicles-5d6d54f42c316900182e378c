(Nissan) is recalling certain 2019 Nissan Altima vehicles. The brake switch bracket may be in the incorrect location, which may cause the brake switch to remain on.","consequence":"If the brake switch remains in the ON position, the brake lights will remain illuminated when the brakes are not being pressed, which may confuse other drivers. Additionally, the transmission shift lever may be moved out of the Park position without the brake pedal being pressed, allowing the vehicle to roll unexpectedly. Either condition increases the risk of a crash.","remedy":"Nissan will notify owners, and dealers will inspect and install a new brake pedal as needed, free of charge. The recall began May 15, 2019. Owners may contact Nissan customer service at 1-800-867-7669.","state":"sent","vehicles":[{"id":"5d9e68be8b079e002a251840","make":"NISSAN","model":"ALTIMA","year":2019}]}}}
