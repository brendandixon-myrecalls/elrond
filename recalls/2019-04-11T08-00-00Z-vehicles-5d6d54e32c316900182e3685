In the event of a roll over crash, the side curtain/head protection air bags may not deploy as intended due to a rollover sensor system that is not enabled. The system also lacks an instrument cluster warning light and a description of the system in the owner's manual. As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 226, \"Ejection Mitigation.\"","consequence":"If the side air bags do not deploy as intended in a roll over crash, it can increase the risk of injury.","remedy":"Karma will notify owners, and dealers will replace the existing Airbag Control Unit (ACU) with a rollover enabled ACU and the owners manual will be updated with the description of the system, free of charge. The recall began July 1, 2019. Owners may contact Karma customer service at 1-855-288-6109.
