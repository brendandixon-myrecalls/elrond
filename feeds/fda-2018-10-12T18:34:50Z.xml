	 <title>Consumer Alert: Sprout Creek Farm “Margie” Cheese Batch Recalled</title>
	 <description>Today the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets alerted consumers to a pasteurization problem with one of Sprout Creek Farm&#39;s pasteurized cow&#39;s milk cheeses, &quot;Margie,&quot; made on 8/28/2018. Sprout Creek Farm is located in Poughkeepsie, NY.

	 <title>Oscor Inc. Issues Recall of TB – Temporary Bipolar Pacing Lead (Unshrouded 2 mm Pins Models)</title>
	 <description>During the use of some TB - Temporary Bipolar Pacing Leads, featuring the 2mm unshrouded connectors, the connector cap housing (see Picture 1, No. 2 Pin Cap and Cover) may slide and potentially expose the connection wire. In some instances, this may cause the wire to be more susceptible to loss of connectivity or breakage during movement of the cables causing interruption of the pacing system.  The analysis of the returned devices attributed the failure to a design change of the cap housing of the pins.  In the last six years, a total of four serious injuries were reported to Oscor which were attributed to a connector cap malfunction causing the lead connector to separate during use potentially leading to an interruption of the pacing system.</description>
