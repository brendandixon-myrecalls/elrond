    <link>http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/</link>
    <description>The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is an office within the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). ODI conducts defect investigations and administers safety recalls to support the NHTSA&apos;s mission to improve safety on our Nation&apos;s highways. NHTSA is authorized to order manufacturers to recall and repair child_seat or items of motor vehicle equipment when ODI investigations indicate that they contain serious safety defects in their design, construction, or performance. ODI also monitors the adequacy of manufacturers&apos; recall campaigns. Before initiating an investigation, ODI carefully reviews the body of consumer complaints and other available data to determine whether a defect trend may exist.</description>
